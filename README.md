# Birds of Østfold

## Description

This is a simple app built using React with Typescript and Styled-Components.
The Birds of Østfold site allows users to log bird sightings in their area as well as viewing
other peoples sightings.

A user can login which will give special access to 'members only' bird sightings and to keep a log of their
own sightings. They will also gain rank the more sightings they log. The hightest being a gold ranking birder.
For a test public user:
email: public@public.com
password: Pass1234

Admins for the site have the ability to add sightings themself, they can also moderate other peoples sightings.
Before a sighting is available to the public it must be varified by an admin. An admin can also choose to delete a
sighting if they deem it necessary.

Admins can also add, edit and delete events that are happening in the area.

Admins can edit a users status giving admin status, or deleting a user.
For a test admin user:
email: admin@admin.com
password: Pass1234
